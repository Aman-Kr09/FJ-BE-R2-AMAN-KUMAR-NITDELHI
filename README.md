## Quick Start

Prerequisites: Node.js 24+, PostgreSQL, npm

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root (see recommended variables below)

3. Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production start

```bash
npm start
```

Open: http://localhost:3000

---

## Recommended Environment Variables

Required or strongly recommended variables:

- `PORT` (optional) — default 3000
- `SESSION_SECRET` — required
- `DATABASE_URL` or `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — optional (email)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — optional (OAuth)
- `BASE_URL` — public URL used in emails
- `XAI_API_KEY` — optional (AI integrations)

---

## API & Routes

This app is server-rendered with EJS templates and exposes route handlers under `routes/`:

- `/dashboard` — main user dashboard
- `/transactions` — transaction management and import
- `/budgets` — budget management
- `/savings` — savings and plans
- `/reports` — analytics and anomaly views

For programmatic imports and health checks, see `test-db.js` and `check-env.js` utilities.

---

## Deployment

Deployment artifacts for Render are already included (`render.yaml`, `Procfile`). Recommended steps:

1. Use managed PostgreSQL with SSL enabled
2. Set environment variables securely in the platform
3. Use `DATABASE_URL` in production for convenience

Render quick notes: configure `start` script to `npm start` and ensure Node engine matches `package.json`.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Fork, branch, and open a pull request. Keep changes focused and add tests where possible.

---

## Troubleshooting

- DB connection errors: verify `DATABASE_URL` or `DB_*` values.
- OAuth or email issues: confirm provider credentials and `BASE_URL`.
- Missing assets: ensure `public/` static files are present and served.

If you'd like, I can add badges, screenshots, or a Render deploy button, or convert the Live Demo link into a CTA button. Tell me which you prefer.

The solution is built on Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and EJS, with a service-oriented backend structure designed for maintainability and production readiness.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later
- PostgreSQL 13 or later
- npm

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Start

Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production-like mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Default local URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

Deployment artifacts for Render are included in the repository:
- `render.yaml`
- `Procfile`

Recommended production controls:
- Use managed PostgreSQL with SSL/TLS enabled.
- Use a strong, rotation-ready `SESSION_SECRET`.
- Store secrets exclusively in platform-managed environment settings.
- Enforce HTTPS and maintain a stable `BASE_URL`.

## Security and Data Controls

- Passwords are never stored in plain text and are hashed with bcrypt.
- Authenticated routes are protected by Passport session validation.
- Sensitive credentials are externalized via environment variables.
- Duplicate import checks reduce accidental data duplication risk.
- Anomaly workflows support review-driven false-positive handling.

## Operational Scripts

| Script | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | `npm start` | Starts the application in standard runtime mode |
| Dev | `npm run dev` | Starts the application with nodemon for local iteration |
| Test | `npm test` | Placeholder command (test suite not configured yet) |

## Roadmap

Planned or recommended enhancements:
- Automated test coverage across unit, integration, and route layers.
- Role-based access control and administrative auditing capabilities.
- Expanded statement import adapters for additional banking formats.
- Scheduled monthly summaries and digest notifications.
- Container-based deployment and CI/CD workflow standardization.
